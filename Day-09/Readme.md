## Sample Solutions

### Single Number (136)
- Uses XOR operation.
- Duplicate numbers cancel each other.
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

### Contains Duplicate (217)
- Uses `HashSet` to detect duplicates efficiently.
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(n)`

### Candy (135)
- Uses a two-pass greedy approach:
  1. Traverse left to right.
  2. Traverse right to left.
- Ensures every child receives the minimum required candies.

### Pascal's Triangle (118)
- Builds each row using values from the previous row.
- Time Complexity: `O(n²)`

### Binary Search
- Searches an element in a sorted array.
- Time Complexity: `O(log n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`
